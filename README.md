# Snowflake Data Sharing & Data Masking Project
## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **secure data sharing and data masking** using **Snowflake**. The focus is on ensuring data privacy while enabling seamless data collaboration. The key aspects covered in this project include:

- **Data insertion** into Snowflake tables
- **Data masking policies** to protect sensitive information
- **Secure data sharing** across Snowflake accounts
- **Role creation and access control** for managing permissions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Snowflake** – Cloud Data Warehouse
- **SQL** – Query Language for data processing, masking, and sharing
- **Snowflake Secure Views & Masking Policies** – Access Control
- **Python & SnowSQL** – Optional for automation

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Insertion:** Insert structured data into Snowflake tables.
2. **Data Masking:** Apply security policies to restrict access to sensitive data.
3. **Data Sharing:** Enable secure data access across Snowflake accounts.
4. **Role Management:** Create roles and grant appropriate privileges for security enforcement.

## 🛠 Role Creation & Granting Permissions
Role-based access control is essential for managing permissions and ensuring secure data access in Snowflake. In this project, roles are created to define different levels of access and assigned to users accordingly. Permissions are granted at the database, schema, and table levels to ensure users have only the necessary access required for their responsibilities. By implementing role-based access control (RBAC), we enhance security, streamline user management, and enforce data governance best practices. Assigning roles to users ensures controlled access to data, minimizing security risks while maintaining efficient collaboration.

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
✅ Data is securely inserted into Snowflake tables.  
✅ Sensitive information (e.g., email addresses) is masked for unauthorized users.  
✅ Data is shared securely without physical duplication.  
✅ Role-based access control ensures security and efficient management of permissions.
